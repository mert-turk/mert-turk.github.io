    <h1 class="title">8-Bit Microprocessor Design</h1>

    <p class="project-detail-text">
    Purpose of the project is the understanding of microprocessor basics. Since I am
    a Embedded System Engineer, I wanted to understand deeply what is going on under
    the hood.
    </p>

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and built a functional 8-bit microprocessor from discrete
          74xx series logic chips to execute basic mathematical operations.</li>
      <li>The core objective was to deconstruct and understand the
          fundamental architecture of a CPU, providing a hardware-level
          foundation for my career in embedded software engineering.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Architected the system to include an ALU, control unit, program
          counter, and instruction register using 74xx ICs.</li>
      <li>Implemented a manual clock circuit for step-by-step execution and debugging.</li>
      <li>Wrote and loaded low-level machine code to test arithmetic and
          logic operations.</li>
    </ul>
