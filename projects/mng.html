    <p class="project-detail-text">
      Measurement Network Gateway collects data from multiple sensor nodes and routes
      it to a user interface to inform users about the system. Sensor data is acquired
      by the Programmable Logic (FPGA) due to its high I/O capability and parallel
      sampling, while the Processing System (ARM Cortex-A9) is used for
      networking and control management. On the Zynq platform, symmetric 
      multiprocessing (SMP) is utilized. Linux is used as the operating system.
    </p>

    <h3>What?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>SW/HW co-design for sampling sensor nodes with the PL, and control 
        management and networking with the PS using Embedded Linux.</li>
      <li>The core objective is to create reliable networking between the SoC and 
        the GUI, enabling communication for controlling sensor sampling 
        frequencies, managing sensors, and performing read/write operations via 
        the AXI interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented SPI in VHDL using Vivado.</li>
      <li>Created AXI IP to control hardware from the PS side.</li>
      <li>Embedded Linux image created using PetaLinux.</li>
      <li>GUI developed using the GTK library.</li>
    </ul>
